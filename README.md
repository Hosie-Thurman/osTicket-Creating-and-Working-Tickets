<h1>osTicket: Creating and Working Tickets</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this last section of the osTicket project, I go through the life cycle of a ticket from creation, to resolution. I make changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets, changing the SLA (Service Level Agreement), and commenting to create a thread of clear communication. 
<br/>
<br/>

This is a continuation of the [osTicket: Post Installation Configuration](https://github.com/ccollins-21/osTicket-Post-Installation-Configuration) project.
<br />

<h3>Step 3: Logging in as Jane Doe and solving the Ticket</h3>

    * Go to the osTicket staff/admin panel.
    * Enter the Jane Doe credentials (username & password).
    * Click Log in.
- Find the Test Ticket:
    * Navigate to the Tickets section.
    * Look for the test ticket you just created.
- Monitor the Ticket:
 Typically we would investigate the Issue and troubleshoot to find a solution
Once a solution is found we will update the Ticket by adding a response providing the solution and what caused the issue. Once that is updated we will finalize and close the ticket
