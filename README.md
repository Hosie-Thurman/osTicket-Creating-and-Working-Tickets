<h1>osTicket: Creating and Working Tickets</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this last section of the osTicket project, I go through the life cycle of a ticket from creation, to resolution. I make changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets, changing the SLA (Service Level Agreement), and commenting to create a thread of clear communication. 
<br/>
<br/>

This is a continuation of the [osTicket: Post Installation Configuration](https://github.com/ccollins-21/osTicket-Post-Installation-Configuration) project.
